# spring-boot-foundation

This repository is a hands-on learning and exploration project for Spring Boot,
focused on understanding its core concepts, runtime model, and production-oriented practices.

The goal is not to build a demo application, but to establish a solid foundation
for long-running, maintainable Java backend services using Spring Boot.

## Objectives

- Understand Spring Boot’s auto-configuration and startup mechanism
- Build minimal but realistic backend services
- Explore configuration, observability, and runtime behavior
- Evolve the project incrementally with production mindset

## Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Maven

## Project Status

- Initial repository setup
- Spring Boot bootstrap coming next
